# Morse Code Research

## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a system that uses sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters and numbers. It was invented for long-distance communication using telegraphs.

## History
Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was used to send messages through telegraph lines and later by ships and aircraft.

## How it Works
Each character in the English alphabet is assigned a combination of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals).

## Alphabet in Morse Code:
A – .-  
B – -...  
C – -.-.  
D – -..  
E – .  
F – ..-.  
G – --.  
H – ....  
I – ..  
J – .---  
K – -.-  
L – .-..  
M – --  
N – -.  
O – ---  
P – .--.  
Q – --.-  
R – .-.  
S – ...  
T – -  
U – ..-  
V – ...-  
W – .--  
X – -..-  
Y – -.--  
Z – --..

## Examples:
- HELLO = .... . .-.. .-.. ---  
- WORLD = .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
